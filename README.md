# Quizzer

Quizzer is an AI-based music quiz. It uses OpenAI's API to generate questions, and Spotify's API to explore the player's musical preferences.

Python library dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

API keys for OpenAI and Spotify should be defined as environment variables or in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```
